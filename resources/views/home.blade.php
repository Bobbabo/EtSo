            EtSo is an experimental prototype based on real ethical values and considerations.
            On this site, you can read about the ethical values of EtSo, and possibly be inspired by the 
            possibility of ethical social media platforms in the future!
            <br><br>
            These are our values:
        <h4>
            
        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            Social media should be available to everyone: <br>
        </strong>
        Social media should be free to access for everyone, and nothing should be hidden behind a paywall. 
        EtSo will strive to make it possible for any user to have access to all features on the site, without having to 
        pay with money nor data.
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            The spread of fake news should be fought while true information should be promoted:
             <br>
        </strong>
            Studies have shown that false information spreads much faster than true information on most social media platforms. 
            As a social media platform, it is our responsibility to make sure that users can easily distinguish between 
            true and potentially false information.
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            Algorithms should avoid creating echo chambers, and instead focus on integrating more diverse views:
             <br>
        </strong>
        Echo chambers can lead to many societal consequences. When a user is exclusively provided with content that 
        fits their current taste, there is a big risk of causing confirmation bias. This effect has been shown to lead 
        to social and political polarization, which is why it should be avoided by diversifying the content shown to the user.
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            The mental well-being of the user should be in focus:
             <br>
        </strong>
            Any element that unnecessarily can cause addiction should be avoided. 
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            Each user should own their own data:
             <br>
        </strong>
            The data that a user has on our platform will be treated as the user’s property. 
            Our service will only use the data to improve the experience for the user. This means that the user’s data 
            will never be used for anything that the user has not directly approved, and the user will always be able to 
            remove their data from the site.
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            Features should be focused on improving the user’s life, not gaining more engagement:
             <br>
        </strong>
            By improving the life of the user, it is natural that the engagement might rise, and that is ok. 
            The problem only arises when a feature makes the user engagement higher, while the quality of the user’s life 
            is not being improved
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            The user should have the freedom to choose any platform they would like without losing their network:
             <br>
        </strong>
            Most users of social media are bound to the platforms that they use mainly by the network effect. 
            EtSo will attempt to make it possible to keep contacts across social media platforms, so that the choice 
            of platform does not have to be determined by which platform is used by most friends.
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            A constant effort should be made to keep all user data secure:
             <br>
        </strong>
           A lot of data in the wrong hands can be harmful to society as a whole, that is why EtSo will 
           strive to have the necessary security measures to protect all user data.
        </h5>

        <h5><strong>
            <br>
            Transparency is important for trust:
             <br>
        </strong>
            While EtSo will keep the user’s data private, all features and intentions of EtSo will 
            be publicly available for all users. 
        </h5>
